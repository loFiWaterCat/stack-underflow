# Stack Underflow
---

Stack Underflow is a clone of Stack Overflow, if you couldn't already tell. It provides a forum for users to ask questions and recieve answers, as well as a voting system for the community to filter out unproductive questions and answers. Best thing is you won't get downvoted, probably.

## Tech stack

It's a bit dated but here we go:
* Backend: Ruby on Rails, Postgresql
  - To manage user data, including their questions, answers, comments, and votes
* Frontend: React, Redux
  - To display information related to questions

## Splash Page

The first thing a user sees with quick links to log in and sign up.
