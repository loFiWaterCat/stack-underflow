Here's the deal. You want the Stack Overflow experience without getting downvoted to oblivion. You can get it here. Stack Underflow is a clone of Stack Overflow, and provides the core functionality that the user needs to ask questions and post answers. Best thing is you won't get downvoted, probably

* Frontend: React, Redux
  - To display information related to questions
